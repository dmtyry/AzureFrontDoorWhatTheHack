# WhatTheHack: Internet happened to my website! 

## Introduction

The Internet is much like water, in one hand an amazing thing that provides life/capability for so much, but in the other hand can be the most destructive force in nature.  Large numbers of users, large size and/or number of resources on pages, malicious activity, site slows down the further away it is, or events triggering massive spikes in traffic are only a few of the problems that we need to adresss.  This challenge based hack is intended to teach you how to evolve a simulated ContosoMasks web site into a globally accelerated and protected web site.
