## Introduction

**What is GitHub?**

GitHub is a largest online software development platform used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects. As of November 2021, GitHub had over 73 million developers and more than 200 million repositories (including at least 28 million public repositories). GitHub offers free and paid products for storing and collaborating on code. Some products apply only to personal accounts, while other plans apply only to organization and enterprise accounts. With GitHub Free for personal accounts, you can work with unlimited collaborators on unlimited public repositories with a full feature set, and on unlimited private repositories with a limited feature set.

**What are forks?**

A fork is your own copy of a repository. Forks let you make changes to a project without affecting the original repository. Forking a repository is similar to copying a repository.
