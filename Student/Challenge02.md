# Challenge 2 - Publish ContosoMasks website

[< Previous Challenge [1]](./Challenge01.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge [3] >](./Challenge03.md)

## Pre-requisites

- Azure subscription
- Your own GitHub repo with the source code of ContosoMasks

## Introduction

When it comes to publishing a website to the Internet, we need to keep in mind a few basics:<br/>
Web Browsers (Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox etc) are the general clients used to interact with Web Sites. For a Web Browser to load a web site, generally you need the following:
- A Domain Name 
  - This lets your Web Browser take ***www.contosomasks.com*** and turn that into an IP Address to then talk to.
- Something to host your content/website
  - There are lots of choices to run the application code and/or store the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files.

## Ok, we need domain name and some kind of server to host the website source code... but where —Åan we find them?

Fortunately, Azure has a solution for all of the above!

**Azure App Service** is a fully managed platform as a service (PaaS) designed for hosting web sites, web applications, REST API and many other things. 

Key features of Azure App Service:
- Supports multiple languages and frameworks - ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, Python and PowerShell.
- Integrates with Azure DevOps, GitHub, BitBucket, Docker Hub, or Azure Container Registry.
- Autoscalable out of the box
- Can be injected to Virtual Networks <br/>

and dozens of others!

Ok, we've decided where to host the website. But how to get the code to App Service?

There are several options: deploy via FTP, use some IDE plugins, but the most modern way is to use **Continious Deployment** - software engineering approach in which software is delivered through automated deployments. Modern cloud services (such as Azure App Service) provides **out-of-the box functionality** to configure autodeployment of your source code to the App Service instance! 

## Description

For this challenge we are going to:
- Deploy the App Service instance
- Publish the source code to App Service by setting up GitHub integration
- Check out your freshly deployed website

## Success Criteria

- Show the newly deployed resources in the Azure Portal
- Demonstrate that your website is up and running

 <!--
## Bonus task , if time permits
- Modify the source code to change the heading from "Contoso Masks" to something new and make sure it is updated on your website.
